Accurately and Efficiently Identifying Centers of Circular Symmetry in Images | In cases such as the detection of circles at any scale in an image, it is important to be able to quantify the degree of circular symmetry about a point and use it to identify centers of high degree of circular symmetry in an image. This writeup describes a good metric for quantifying amount of circular symmetry and an efficient algorithm for finding the degree of rotational symmetry about every point in an N Ã— M image at once in O(NM lg NM) time using gradient and cross-correlation.
